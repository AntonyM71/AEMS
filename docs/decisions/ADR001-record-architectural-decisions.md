# Architectural Decision Record: Recording Architectural Decisions

## Context:

As our project grows, it becomes increasingly important to document the architectural decisions made by the team. This practice ensures that we have a clear understanding of the rationale behind each decision, which can be valuable for future reference, onboarding new team members, and maintaining project consistency.

## Decision:

We will adopt a standardized approach for recording architectural decisions using Architectural Decision Records (ADRs).

## Rationale:

### Clear Documentation:

Recording architectural decisions provides clear documentation of the choices made and the reasoning behind them. This helps in maintaining transparency and understanding the context of decisions.

### Future Reference:

ADRs serve as a valuable resource for future reference, allowing the team to revisit past decisions and understand the historical context. This is especially useful when considering changes or improvements.

### Onboarding New Team Members:

New team members can quickly get up to speed by reviewing ADRs. This helps them understand the project's architecture and the decisions that have shaped it, reducing the learning curve.

## Consistency:

ADRs promote consistency in decision-making by providing a structured format for documenting and evaluating architectural choices. This helps in ensuring that decisions align with the project's goals and principles.

## Consequences:

### Positive:

- Improved transparency and documentation of architectural decisions.

- Enhanced ability to revisit and understand past decisions.

- Process of writing an ADR often helps clarify thoughts and concerns, getting halfway through writing one and changing your mind is a feature, not a bug.

- Easier onboarding process for new team members.

- Future maintainers can understand why a decision was made, and review to see if the same contraints still exist.

- Greater consistency in architectural decision-making.

### Negative:

- Additional time and effort required to document architectural decisions.

- Potential need for training team members on the ADR process and format.

## Implementation:

We will establish a template for ADRs and integrate the practice into our development workflow. Team members will be encouraged to record architectural decisions as they are made. Regular reviews of ADRs will be conducted to ensure they remain up-to-date and relevant.

## Review:

The adoption of ADRs will be reviewed periodically to assess its effectiveness and value to the project. Feedback from the team will be collected to make any necessary adjustments to the process.
