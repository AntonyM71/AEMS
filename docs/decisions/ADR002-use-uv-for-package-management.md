# Architectural Decision Record: Transition from pip to uv as Package Manager

## Context:

Our team has traditionally used pip as the primary package manager for Python projects. While it has been effective, we have identified several issues and limitations with pip that prompt a reevaluation of our package management approach.

##Decision:
We have decided to transition from pip to uv as our primary package manager for Python projects.

## Rationale:

### Faster Environment Build Times:

uv has demonstrated significantly faster environment build times compared to pip. This improvement translates to increased developer productivity and reduced wait times during environment setup.

### Issues with Running pip as Root:

Our setup often requires running commands with elevated privileges. Using pip as the package manager in these scenarios has presented security risks and complications. uv handles these situations more gracefully, providing a safer and more reliable solution.

### Conda License Issues:

While we considered using conda as an alternative to pip, we encountered license restrictions that posed challenges for our project's open-source compliance and distribution. uv does not have these licensing issues, making it a more suitable choice for our needs.

### Ability to Use Lock Files:

One of the key advantages of uv is its ability to create and manage lock files. These lock files ensure deterministic builds by specifying exact dependency versions. This feature helps mitigate risks associated with dependency conflicts and inconsistencies, providing a more stable deployment process.

## Consequences:

### Positive:

- Improved developer experience due to faster build times and safer privilege management.

- Enhanced stability and reproducibility of our environments with the use of lock files.

- Compliance with open-source licensing requirements.

### Negative:

- Initial learning curve for team members transitioning from pip to uv.

- Potential adjustments required for existing CI/CD pipelines and development workflows.

- Implementation: We will update our project documentation to reflect the change to uv as the package manager. Additionally, we will provide training sessions and support materials to help team members transition smoothly. The migration process will be phased to ensure minimal disruption to ongoing development activities.

## Review:

This decision will be reviewed periodically to ensure that uv continues to meet our needs and provide the intended benefits. Feedback from the development team will be collected and used to refine our approach as necessary.
