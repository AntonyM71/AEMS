# Architectural Decision Record: Replacing fastapi-quickcrud With Agentic Coding Solutions

## Context:

Our project previously relied on the `fastapi-quickcrud` library to automatically generate CRUD endpoints. While this initially accelerated development, the library has become poorly maintained, is no longer actively updated, and remains tied to outdated Python versions. These limitations created friction during upgrades, reduced compatibility with modern FastAPI features, and introduced long‑term maintenance risks.

To ensure the stability and longevity of our API layer, we needed a sustainable way to replace the autogenerated endpoints without manually rewriting large portions of the codebase.

## Options Considered:

### 1. Continue Using fastapi-quickcrud
- Minimal short‑term effort  
- Library is outdated and unmaintained  
- Blocks upgrades to newer Python and FastAPI versions  
- Increasing technical debt over time  

### 2. Rewrite All Endpoints Manually
- Maximum control and long‑term stability  
- Significant development effort  
- High risk of regressions without extensive testing  

### 3. Replace the Library With Another CRUD Generator
- Some alternatives exist, but many are also limited or opinionated  
- Risk of repeating the same dependency and maintenance issues  

### 4. Use Agentic Coding Solutions to Regenerate Endpoints (Chosen Option)
- Automatically produce clean, modern FastAPI endpoints  
- Removes dependency on unmaintained libraries  
- Enables migration to current Python versions  
- Allows iterative refinement and testing without large manual rewrites  

## Decision:

We have decided to remove `fastapi-quickcrud` and regenerate the affected endpoints using agentic coding solutions. This approach replaces the outdated autogenerated code with maintainable, explicit FastAPI implementations while avoiding the cost of rewriting everything manually.

## Rationale:

### Eliminates Dependency on an Unmaintained Library:

`fastapi-quickcrud` is no longer actively supported and is incompatible with newer Python versions. Continuing to rely on it would introduce long‑term risk and block future upgrades.

### Modern, Maintainable Endpoint Code:

Agentic coding tools allow us to generate clean, idiomatic FastAPI endpoints that are easy to read, test, and extend. This results in a codebase that is fully under our control and aligned with current best practices.

### Faster Migration With Lower Risk:

Instead of manually rewriting dozens of endpoints, agentic coding solutions automate the bulk of the work. This reduces human error, accelerates the migration, and ensures consistent structure across the API.

### Future‑Proofing the Project:

By removing the dependency on autogenerated CRUD libraries, we gain full flexibility to adopt new FastAPI features, update Python versions, and evolve the API without external constraints.

## Consequences:

### Positive:
- Removes reliance on an outdated and unmaintained library  
- Enables migration to modern Python and FastAPI versions  
- Produces clean, explicit, maintainable endpoint code  
- Reduces long‑term technical debt  
- Faster and safer migration compared to manual rewrites  

### Negative:
- Requires initial effort to validate and test regenerated endpoints  
- Some custom logic may need manual review or refinement  
- Short‑term development time investment  

## Implementation:

We will:

1. Remove all usage of `fastapi-quickcrud` from the codebase.  
2. Use agentic coding tools to regenerate CRUD endpoints based on existing models and schemas.  
3. Review and refine the generated code to ensure correctness and maintainability.  
4. Add or update automated tests to validate endpoint behaviour.  
5. Proceed with upgrading Python and FastAPI to supported versions.  

## Review:

This decision will be revisited after the migration is complete or if future tooling changes introduce new opportunities for automation. Feedback from developers and maintainers will inform whether additional refactoring or standardisation is needed.
