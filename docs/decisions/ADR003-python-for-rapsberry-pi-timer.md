# Architectural Decision Record: Using Python for Raspberry Pi Timer Development

## Context:

Our team is tasked with developing a simple timer application for a Raspberry Pi. While languages like C and Rust offer potential performance and accuracy benefits, we need to weigh these against our specific project requirements and constraints. The decision must take into account factors such as development speed, existing codebase, system performance needs, and integration capabilities.

## Decision:

We have decided to use Python as the primary programming language for the Raspberry Pi timer application.

## Rationale:

### Faster Development and Prototyping:

Python's simplicity and readability enable rapid prototyping and development, which are crucial for our project timeline. Its rich ecosystem of libraries further accelerates hardware interaction.

### Alignment with Existing Codebase:

Our current codebase is written in Python. Continuing with Python ensures consistency and avoids the overhead of introducing a new language into the project, such as C or Rust.

### Acceptable Timing Limitations:

While Python may not offer the low-level precision of C or Rust for timing operations, this disadvantage is negligible for our application, as it primarily depends on human reaction times rather than microsecond accuracy.

### Ease of WebSocket Integration:

Python simplifies WebSocket integration, which is essential for our project. Libraries such as and allow us to handle real-time communication efficiently with minimal complexity compared to C or Rust.

## Consequences:

### Positive:

- Faster time-to-market due to Python's developer-friendly features.
- Reduced learning curve and technical overhead by leveraging the team's existing Python expertise.
- Seamless WebSocket integration for real-time communication.

### Negative:

- Slightly higher resource consumption compared to C or Rust.
- Limited precision in timing operations, although acceptable for our use case.

## Implementation:

We will proceed with Python for all components of the Raspberry Pi timer. Existing Python libraries for hardware interaction and WebSocket communication will be evaluated and incorporated into the project.

## Review:

The decision to use Python will be revisited upon project completion or if new performance bottlenecks emerge. Feedback from the development process will be collected to inform future decisions about language choice.
